# Introduction
The ACS Assist is a project developed by former Senior students at The College of New Jersey. The project aims to support individuals impacted by Adehsive Capsulitis of Shoulder through the use of therapeutic heating and monitoring of shoulder throughout therapy. A more detailed overview of the project and historical development can be found on the project's [official website](https://engprojects.tcnj.edu/acs-assist-20/). 

**It should be noted that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, project development has been halted and no further progress has been made beyond that listed on the project website and the `Senior Project II Final Report` document. Those who are interested in more details of the project's progress and development should explore this document.**


# Project Components (Hardware)
The ACS Assist consists of several major physical components:
1.  Arduino Nano 33 BLE - This device provides the means for measuring [ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion) Angles, and control of the device's connection to a smartphone for monitoring. This device will also enable the control of device heating. 
   
2.  Carbon Fiber Tape - This component is capable of heating up to 43Â°C to provide therapeutic heating. 
   
3.  Thermistor - To monitor device temperature during heating.   

4. Battery - To allow the device to function with no wires. 

5. Polyester and Nylon - To form the outer shell of the device. 

# Project Components (Software)
1. The ACS Smartphone App - This app enables the wearer to control their ACS Assist device during therapeutic exercise, as well as monitor progress and provide a means of communication with the wearer's physical therapist. 
   
2. The ACS Assist Web App - This app enables the physical therapist to monitor patient progress in regards to therapy, as well as communication to the patient
